# Teleoperation Notebook

This version of the teleoperation notebook was uploaded to address a specific issue: inconsistent reversing behavior observed in earlier versions.

Through testing, we found that reverse throttle required a higher initial value to consistently engage movement, especially from a standstill. This version incorporates that behavior and improves the reliability of reverse control.

**Key Notes**
- Reverse throttle has been tuned to ensure consistent movement.
- This version may exhibit more input lag compared to the original teleoperation notebook.
- Intended for scenarios where precision in reverse is more critical than low-latency response

# Modified Training

The modified training is the necessary notebook to train a road following model, utilize the README on how to train it on the Athena server.

# Improved Road following

This notebook is designed to combine the Collision Avoidance model and the Road Following model into a singular notebook where it will follow a road and avoid obstacles.
